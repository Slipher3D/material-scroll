# material-scroll
A modal operator for Blender 2.93.1 that makes changing materials and material slots, fast and easy.

In early stages but largely works in its current iteration.

How to use:


1. Set a hotkey to the operator "object.ms_ot_material_scroll" or use the default alt+c.

2. Select the meshes you want.

3. Hit alt+c or your own hotkey.

4. Scroll up and down to change the material of the actively selected mesh, hold down ctrl and scroll to change the material slot of the active object.

5. Change active object from the current selection by Z and X.

6. Left or right click to end operator.


Note: Changes are planned to how the active object selection works and how to change to scrolling through material slots.
